# Deployment of Django in Heroku

- Step 1 : Create an account in [Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/t/platform?c=7013A000000ib1xQAA&gclid=Cj0KCQjw3s_4BRDPARIsAJsyoLMyAQ08MU3SMAOTHD-gg_kp7ypSIAR0UEnZns2VpUWm4kkUX6AyBeEaAi8UEALw_wcB)

- Step 2 : Download and install the [Heroku Command Line Interface](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) (CLI) which makes it easy to create and manage your Heroku apps directly from the terminal. It’s an essential part of using Heroku.

- Step 3 : The Heroku CLI requires Git, the popular version control system. If you don’t already have Git installed, complete the following before installing the CLI:

    * [Git installation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
    * [First-time Git setup](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup)

- Step 4 :Run the command heroku on your terminal

```
$ heroku

- Step 5 :Login to your heroku account and close the window
```
heroku login
```
- Step 6 :Install [Gunicorn](https://pypi.org/project/gunicorn/),Gunicorn ‘Green Unicorn’ is a Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX.The Gunicorn server is broadly compatible with various web frameworks, simply implemented, light on server resource usage, and fairly speedy .

```
pip install gunicorn
```
- Step 7 :To show the currently installed package with version run the command below
```
$ pip freeze 


Django==3.0.8
dj-database-url==0.3.0
dj-static==0.0.6
gunicorn==19.6.0
Unipath==1.0
python-decouple==3
Pillow==3.3.0
Markdown==2.6.6
bleach==1.4.3
psycopg2==2.6.1
whitenoise==3.2


```
- Step 8 :Save the currently installed package with version in  requirements.txt file

```
pip freeze > requirements.txt

```
- Step 9 : Initialized the folder in the Git repository

```
$ git init

Initialized empty Git repository in /home/steffy/Desktop/django-heroku/.git/

```
- Step 10 : Need a Gitignore file to ignore all files that don’t matter and shouldn’t be in your git repository. Think of your virtual environment and all the .pyc files. Those are both generated and can be generated by anyone that has access to your code. Therefore, it’s unnecessary to add those to your repository.Create a [.gitignore file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/master/Python.gitignore) in the folder.

- Step 11 :Add all files in the Git 
```
git add -A

```
- Step 12 : To show the current status that what all files had to be committed in the git run the command below:
```
git status

```

- Step 13 : Commit the files locally to the git
```
git commit -m "Initial Commit"

```

- Step 14 : To show the current status that what all files had to be committed in the git run the command below:
```
git status

```

- Step 15 : Create an app in Heroku.If the name you had given is existing then change the name and create another name.At first I had given mypythondjangoapp as my app name , it was an existing one .Then I changed it to myawesomepythondjangoapp,it was a unique name so it had create myawesomepythondjangoapp in heroku.
```
$ heroku create mypythondjangoapp

Creating ⬢ mypythondjangoapp... !
 ▸    Name mypythondjangoapp is already taken
(venv) steffy@steffy:~/Desktop/django-heroku$ heroku create myawesomepythondjangoapp
Creating ⬢ myawesomepythondjangoapp... done
https://myawesomepythondjangoapp.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/myawesomepythondjangoapp.git

```

- Step 16 : Open your App in Heroku.
```
$ heroku open

```
- Step 17 : Push the data to the git after commiting the changes.
```
git push heroku master

```


- Step 18 : When you open the app, it shows an error that static root is not set.Set Up The Static Assets.STATIC_ROOT is needed for heroku to set up the files.Go to Setting.py file in the project folder and add the STATIC_ROOT.
```
STATIC_ROOT =os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'staticfiles')

```

- Step 19 : Do the steps 11 -14 to commit the changes in the git and Push the data to the heroku master using the step 17 then run the command in Step 16.It will shows an aplication error with heroku logs --tail.Run the command below
```
$ heroku logs --tail

2020-07-13T11:33:59.006251+00:00 heroku[router]: at=error code=H14 desc="No web processes running" method=GET path="/favicon.ico" host=myawesomepythondjangoapp.herokuapp.com request_id=b308cc3e-aa77-4f5d-a9a8-b6adecd3e2fe fwd="59.99.38.203" dyno= connect= service= status=503 bytes= protocol=https


```

- Step 20 : No web processes is running .So Create a ProcFile in the root Folder  with no extentions.It is simply a textfile. Type the data shown below in  the Procfile.Make sure that it should be written correct!.Note it: No extra spacing sholuld be there.Here web: means the web-process type(web traffic when processed)  ,gunicorn- command needed to run the web process (python code to talk with the web process),djangoProject1-django project foldername ,wsgi-web service gateway interface.

```
web: gunicorn djangoProject1.wsgi

```
